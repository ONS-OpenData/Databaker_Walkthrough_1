# simple_Databaker_Walkthrough

explains basic databaker logic and process via  jupyter notebook. Example is included

this should work fine as a just a document to read, but if you want to run the example recipe at the end you'll need to download the "databakerExample.xlsx" included in this repo and have databaker installed on your machine.

if you have - just select and run the INDIVIDUAL cell containing the example (the last but 1 cell in the notebook). Trying to mass-run the whole notebook will throw a few errors as their are out of context code examples in places.
